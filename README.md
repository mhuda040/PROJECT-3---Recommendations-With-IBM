# PROJECT-3---Recommendations-With-IBM

## Project Overview

This project will analyze user interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Community and make recommendations of new articles that cater to those users.  We will create and build a recommendation system to faciliate those interactions between users and articles.

## Required Files

- Jupyter Notebook
  - `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb`:  Main file that contains the necessary code to build our recommendation engine 

- HTML files
  - `Recommendations_with_IBM.html`:  HTML version of main Jupyter Notebook file

- Additional files
  - `project_tests.py, top_20.p, top_10.p, top_5.p`:  These files are standard for this project and required for the recommendation engine.  The code in these files should not be modified in any way

## Installation

Must have Python 3 installed to run the required files.

Must include the following libraries in the Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb file:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- project_tests
- pickle

## Instructions

Run the Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb file 

## Acknowledgements
